    "Among several potential pay-fors in their recent [UBI discussion paper](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/libdems/pages/1811/attachments/original/1621669347/145_-_Universal_Basic_Income.docx_%281%29.pdf?1621669347), the Liberal Democrats considered lowering the personal allowance from its current value of £12,570 to £2,500. That is, the first £2,500 of an individual's annual earnings would be exempted from taxation, rather than the first £12,570. [As my colleague Nikhil Woodruff found](https://www.ubicenter.org/lib-dem-policy-paper), this would raise about £60 billion which, when funding a UBI, significantly lowers poverty and inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Liberal Democrats were not the first to connect the personal allowance and UBI. The Green Party has also proposed effectively exchanging the two policies[^1], and several think tanks have modeled UBIs involving reductions or repeals of the personal allowance. While the personal allowance is highly salient— a 2014 poll found that [85% of the public](https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/personal-allowances-rise-most-popular-conference-season-tax-pledges) supported raising it—it's also a large source of potential revenue for the costly proposition of paying every member of society every month.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, I extend the literature around the personal allowance and UBI by modeling a range of personal allowance values and outcomes. I find that repealing the personal allowance could fund a £29 weekly UBI to all members of society, including children. This reform would cut the overall poverty rate by 29%, deep poverty by 46%, and child poverty by 51%. I also find that personal allowance reductions matter on the margin: each £2,000 cut, when funding a UBI, yields around a 5% decrease in poverty. \n",
    "\n",
    "[^1]: The Green Party states that in their model, UBI will be taxable, but [\"all income tax payers will have a tax-free allowance which is the equivalent to their Universal Basic Income amount\"](https://www.greenparty.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Green-Party-Universal-Basic-Income-Policy.pdf); this means that, in practice, the UBI would not be taxed and the personal allowance would effectively be eliminated.  \n",

   "source": [
    "The personal allowance was [introduced in 1979](http://taxhistory.co.uk/Income%20Tax%20Allowances.htm), and it has grown almost every year since. Liberal Democrats accelerated its growth by [calling](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/libdems-to-let-1-3m-low-earners-avoid-paying-tax-8506838.html) for expanding it from £10,000 in 2015 to £12,500 in 2020; this succeeded, and it now sits at £12,570, where it is [expected to remain until April 2026](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-britain-budget-inc-idUSKBN2AV1LP).\n",
    "\n",
    "While many countries have a tax-free band like the personal allowance, the UK also makes the more uncommon decision to phase it out for higher earners. Individuals earning above £100,000 lose £1 of personal allowance for every £2 in earnings, phasing out fully for those earning £125,140 per year and creating 62% marginal tax rates for earners in this range.\n",
    "\n",
    "These components combine to produce a policy that is neither clearly progressive nor clearly regressive. Because households in the bottom decile have little to no earned income, the personal allowance provides them only small benefits. And while those in the upper individual decile are mostly excluded from the personal allowance, those in the upper household decile [still benefit significantly from it](https://ifs.org.uk/publications/6045), due to marriage between high earners and non-high earners[^2]. Repealing the personal allowance would raise £97 billion (£3,585 per worker) and raise the Gini inequality index from 0.386 to 0.396[^3], indicating that the personal allowance is slightly progressive on a net basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^2]: This and the remaining analysis uses data from 2020, when the personal allowance was set at £12,500.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^3]: The Gini coefficients used throughout are calculated using total household net income weighted by people."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "My research aligns with other analyses showing the progressivity of replacing the personal allowance with UBI. In 2019, the New Economics Foundation [modeled](https://neweconomics.org/2019/03/nothing-personal) replacing the personal allowance with a budget-neutral Weekly National Allowance paid to adults and an increase in the child benefit, making the payments non-taxable but included in means tests. They found progressive results, stating it would “[lift] 200,000 families out of poverty and shift the £8bn currently spent on tax allowances for the 35% highest income families to the remaining 65% of families”. Compass also [modeled](https://www.compassonline.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Compass_BasicIncomeForAll_2019.pdf) replacing the personal allowance with a budget-neutral flat payment of £25 a week for children and adults of working age, as well as a flat rate citizen’s pension of £164.35. They too found progressive results, with the Gini coefficient decreasing from 0.337 to 0.365. Most recently, [my colleagues found](https://www.ubicenter.org/progressive-adjustments-lib-dem-working-group) that the policy in the Liberal Democrats discussion paper could be made more progressive by repealing all, rather than part, of the personal allowance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond these other papers, I've found that the impacts occur roughly linearly on the margin, meaning that the policy concept can operate incrementally. Furthermore, the policy disproportionately benefits children, and separate studies show that this will in turn improve educational and health outcomes. The impacts are largely but not uniformly beneficial to low income households, though losses are small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these findings, UBI proponents in the UK should take a serious look at whether keeping the personal allowance is worthwhile, provided the benefits of the UBI that could be funded through eliminating it."
